Factorial

CSIS 2430-001

Objective:
With your newly chosen programming language, your goal is to implement factorial for a prompted integer. Make sure you include in your analysis how well the algorithm worked with your newly chosen language. When does it fail? Why? 

What Worked:
The algorithm worked well in python. It was very easy to grab the user input from the console. Python is built very nicely to run scripts like this factorial script.  

What Didn’t Work:
I had to research factorials of 0 and 1 so that the program would return the correct answer. I had forgotten that both 0 and 1 return 1.
Comments:
I am very happy so far with the python language and I am excited to program some web applications with it.

Code:
"""Calculate the factorial for the given positive number"""
def factorial(number):
    # If the number is 0 or 1 ... return 1
    if number <= 1:
        return 1
    # Vars for while loop and to store the calculation
    count = 1
    total = 1
    #Loop through to find the factorial
    while count <= number:
        total = total * count
        count += 1
    return total


if __name__ == '__main__':    
    # Display what the program is/does
    print ("\nCalculate the Factorial of a Non-Negative Integer")
    # Get the number the user wants the factorial of
    number = input('\nEnter a number: ')
    # Checks to make sure the number is not negative
    while number < 0:
        # Ask the user for another number
        print('\nPlease enter a positive integer ')
        number = input('Enter a number: ')
    else:
        # Call the function and display the answer
        total = factorial(number)
        print '\nThe Factorial of',number,'is',total
