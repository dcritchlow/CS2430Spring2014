\newcommand{\assignmentDescription}
{Your assignment is to encrypt the following message "The Queen Can't Roll When Sand is in the Jar" using the values for $p=71$, $q=67$, and $e=17$.}
\newcommand{\worked}
{I was able to reuse the code that I had for modular exponentiation. I also used much of what I had already for the Caesar cipher.}
\newcommand{\didntwork}
{I had to implement my own way to split up the letter blocks}
\newcommand{\comments}
{I enjoyed walking through and studying the operations of RSA encryption. I was glad that I was able to use the function that I wrote to split up the letter blocks in more than one function in my code.}
