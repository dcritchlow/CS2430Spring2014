Implement Huffman Coding
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Use this file: Metamorphosis.txt
    \item Convert the file to binary and measure the size.
    \item Implement Huffman Coding to compress the file. (You will calculate the frequencies of all punctuations, etc., build a tree, then use the tree to compress the file (remember, it will be in BINARY - LEAVE IT in this format.)
    \item Measure the newly compressed file.
    \item Answer the question: What is the delta shrinkage (Entropy) from the first file to the second?
    \item Use the frequencies found on page 771 \#27 and reimplement.
    \item Measure the compression again.
    \item Compare\//contrast \(what did you find?, why was there much of a difference?, etc.\)
\end{enumerate}
