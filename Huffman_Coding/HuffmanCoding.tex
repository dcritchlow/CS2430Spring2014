Implement Huffman Coding
\begin{enumerate}\setlength\itemindent{0.5cm}
{
\item Use this file: Metamorphosis.txt
\item Convert the file to binary and measure the size.
\item Implement Huffman Coding to compress the file. (You will calculate the frequencies of all punctuations, etc., build a tree, then use the tree to compress the file (remember, it will be in BINARY - LEAVE IT in this format.)
\item Measure the newly compressed file.
\item Answer the question: What is the delta shrinkage (Entropy) from the first file to the second?
\item Use the frequencies found on page 771 \#27 and reimplement.
\item Measure the compression again.
\item Compare\//contrast (what did you find?, why was there much of a difference?, etc.)
}\end{enumerate}

The first Huffman code resulted in a 46.28\% compression using the
binary code taken from the frequency of letters in the Metamorphosis
document. When I started the first part of this assignment I was sure
that the compression would be much greater than just using the
frequencies in the second portion. As I was coding and looking at the
binary codes that it produced I was pleased with how many bits were
shaved off from the original.

When I was researching Huffman code I realized that the less characters
you have in your input the compression is much higher. As I was pondering
this I was trying to figure out how this would in fact be possible. With
the first part of the assignment I had covered everything from spaces,
carriage returns, tabs, etc. How would it be possible that less characters
would give greater compression?

I started to code the final portion of this assignment and as I was
working through the code and looking at my print statements as I was
forming the Huffman code there definitely was less characters and bits.
Even though there were less bits in the Huffman code in the second part
it did not take any bits off of the carriage returns, tabs, spaces,
etc \ldots

I calculated the size of the second converted file by counting how many
alpha characters that had Huffman codes associated with it and also how
many non-alphanumeric characters there were. I then multiplied the
non-alphanumeric characters by 8 bits and then added that to the number
of alpha characters. The resulting compression was good, 37.24\%, but
not quite as high as the first portion of the assignment.

The non-alphanumeric codes that did not get converted was the difference
and it was interesting to see how much they would actually play a role.
This exercise was nice to be able to go through some other code and
research different ways to form these data structures in Python.
