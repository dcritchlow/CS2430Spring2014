\newcommand{\assignmentDescription}{Implement Huffman Coding
1. Use this file: Metamorphosis.txt
2. Convert the file to binary and measure the size.
3. Implement Huffman Coding to compress the file. (You will calculate the frequencies of all punctuations, etc., build a tree, then use the tree to compress the file (remember, it will be in BINARY - LEAVE IT in this format.)
4. Measure the newly compressed file.
5. Answer the question: What is the delta shrinkage (Entropy) from the first file to the second?
6. Use the frequencies found on page 771 #27 and reimplement.
7. Measure the compression again.
8. Compare/contrast (what did you find?, why was there much of a difference?, etc.)}
