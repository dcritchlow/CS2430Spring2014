Bayes Theorem
Darin Critchlow
CSIS 2430-001


Objective:
You will be implementing a Generalized Bayes Theorem (pg 472).  It should handle French guy/Financial vids.
What Worked:
Everything worked properly
What Didn’t Work:
Everything worked properly
Comments:
It was interesting implementing the general form and working out how to loop through the data based upon the name given.
